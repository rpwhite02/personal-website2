            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>An interactive Dashboard hosted on Github Pages that allows
                users to explore trends in crime in Seattle through 2017 to
                early 2023. Users are able to filter through specific types
                of crime such as crimes against society, property crimes, and
                personal crimes. 
            </p>
            <p>Select different years to see how the
                distributions change over different years, and there is also
                a button to toggle a median income map that can be used to
                accompany the heat map. There is a pie chart on the side bar
                that shows users the distributions of the three types of crime
                measured that were mentioned above.
