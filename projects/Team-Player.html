            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A personal project where I developed a baseball career path puzzle minigame using Node.js, Next.js, 
                React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and Tailwind. The game challenges players to match MLB players with the
                teams they’ve played for over the years.
            </p>
            <p> This project helped me deepen my full-stack development skills and demonstrate my ability to create
                dynamic, interactive web applications. 
            </p>

            <h2>Tech Stack and Implementation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>**Node.js**: Powered the backend logic, with API routes written in TypeScript for type safety.</li>
                <li>**React**: Built the dynamic user interface using TypeScript to ensure component type safety and maintainability.</li>
                <li>**Next.js**: Used for server-side rendering and page routing, all implemented with TypeScript for robust code structure.</li>
                <li>**TypeScript**: The primary language for both the frontend and backend, enforcing static typing and reducing
                    runtime errors across the project.</li>
                <li>**JavaScript**: Used for handling smaller utility functions, like converting CSV data to JSON.</li>
                <li>**Tailwind CSS**: Styled the application’s user interface with a focus on responsive design.</li>
            </ul>
