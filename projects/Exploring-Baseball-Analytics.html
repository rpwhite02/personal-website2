            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A personal project that leverages data science libraries within Python to explore and analyze
                baseball statistics. The aim is to get more comfortable working with popular data science libraries and be able to showcase
                my visualizations and machine learning predictions on a frontend powered by Streamlit. 
            </p>
            <p>Interactive charts and predictive models that display data-driven baseball insights for batting, fielding, and pitching
                statistics. Explore historical data, player and team performances, and predictions about player awards or team standings.
            </p>
