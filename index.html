        <p class="description">I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Geospatial Data Science. I enjoy uncovering patterns and insights
            through spatial data, and I'm eager to explore careers that lie between the fields of GIS and data science. 
        </p>

        <p class="description">During my academic career, I became very familiar with various geospatial technologies and softwares to hone
            my skills in data visualization and statistical analysis, focusing on spatial datasets. My coursework allowed me to work with
            real-world data, stored in many different file types such as shapefiles, geoJSON files, and CSVs. These experiences have taught
            me effective methods of deriving meaninful outcomes in geospatial analysis.
        </p>

        <p class="description">In the summer of 2023 I interned with Tyler Technologies, a software company that provides services to the public
            sector at the local, state, and federal government levels. I interned as a GIS Analyst in the Student Transportation Department where
            I updated school bus routes and attribute tables for several counties across the country, which were stored as file geodatabases. I 
            primarily used ArcMap and ArcCatalog to manage these file geodatabases, along with the built in geoprocessing tools, and Python and SQL
            interpreters within Arcmap. The updated geodatabases were deployed to Tyler's server using ArcCatalog.
