        <p class="description">As a Geospatial Data Science graduate from the University of Washington, I am committed to applying my
            skills in GIS to diverse fields. My goal is to leverage spatial data insights in various industries, combining my expertise
            in GIS with a strong data science foundation.
        </p>

        <p class="description">During my academic career, I became very familiar with various geospatial technologies and softwares to hone
            my skills in data visualization and statistical analysis, focusing on spatial datasets. My coursework allowed me to work with
            real-world data, stored in different file types such as shapefiles, geoJSON files, and CSVs. These experiences have taught
            me effective methods of deriving meaninful outcomes in geospatial analysis using various GIS software such as ESRI ArcGIS and QGIS.
            I created web map applications that utilized web programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries. I'm also
            experienced in data-driven programming using Python and R, and many libraries within the languages to aid data visualizations,
            machine learning predictions, and data engineering tasks. 
        </p>

        <p class="description">In the summer of 2023 I interned with Tyler Technologies, a software company that provides services to the public
            sector at the local, state, and federal government levels. I interned as a GIS Analyst in the Student Transportation Department where
            I updated school bus routes and attribute tables for several counties across the country, which were stored as file geodatabases. I 
            primarily used ArcMap and ArcCatalog to manage these file geodatabases, along with the built in geoprocessing tools, and Python and SQL
            interpreters within Arcmap. The updated geodatabases were deployed to Tyler's server using ArcCatalog.
